/* Below is my process from querying some of the information that I needed for my Case Study on Tourism in Georgia.

Need data for only 5 counties: Fulton,Cobb,Clayton,Dekalb,Gwinnett. Georgia is listed as a county but is for the whole state. Compare Total Spending as percentage to GA as a state. Max and Min in all columns.

Created 2 new tables to support the query for the data that I needed. Wanted data from highest county and lowest county for total spending overall. I also wanted the percentage total compared to the entire state. Below are the queries that I constructed to get there.*/

/*First: Create a table that only has the Five counties that I want to focus on from the dataset of all counties.*/

create TABLE Total_spending_5 as (
select county,
total_spending_m
from GA_COUNTY_2023
WHERE county LIKE '%Fulton%'
OR county LIKE '%Cobb%'
OR county LIKE '%Clayton%'
OR county LIKE '%DeKalb%'
OR county LIKE '%Gwinnett%')

/*Second: Create a table with the aggregate percentages column*/

create or replace table total_spending_p as (
select 
county,
total_spending_m,
((total_spending_m)/35441.7)*100 as Percentage_of_Total
from total_spending_5 )

/*Third: Create a table that only has the aggregate columns for min and max of total spending & percentage to state of GA spending*/

create or replace table Agg_Total_Spending as
(Select 
min(total_spending_m) as Lowest_County,
max(total_spending_m) as Highest_County,
(min(total_spending_m)/35441.7)*100 as lowest_Percentage_of_Total,
(max(total_spending_m)/35441.7)*100 as Highest_Percentage_of_Total
From
TOTAL_SPENDING_P)

/*Fourth: With my newly formed tables, I draft a full join between the two tables where agg_total_spending lowest county table matches the value of the total_spending_p table on the total_spending_m column. I also only want the values that are not Null. To provide a label column to identify the results, I create an alias as 'Lowest County' based on total_spending*/

select county,
total_spending_m,
percentage_of_total,
'Lowest County' as County_Ranking
from total_spending_p full join agg_total_spending on total_spending_p.total_spending_m=agg_total_spending.lowest_county
where Lowest_county is not NULL

/*Five: I then use this information to create a union between the lowest_county and highest_county so that the table will reflect both the top and lowest county within my filtered 5 counties. This was the final query that I needed to get the table that I needed for my data viz.*/

select county,
total_spending_m,
percentage_of_total,
'Lowest County' as County_Ranking
from total_spending_p full join agg_total_spending on total_spending_p.total_spending_m=agg_total_spending.lowest_county
where Lowest_county is not NULL
Union
select county,
total_spending_m,
percentage_of_total,
'Highest County' as County_Ranking
from total_spending_p full join agg_total_spending on total_spending_p.total_spending_m=agg_total_spending.highest_county
where highest_county is not NULL
